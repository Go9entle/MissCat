\title{Convert Factor Levels to Positive Integers}
\usage{
fact_to_int(f)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A factor variable (or a column of factors) to be converted. If `f` is not a factor, it is returned unchanged.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector where each factor level is replaced by its corresponding integer position.
        Missing values (NA) are retained as NA.
}
\description{
This function converts the levels of a factor variable to corresponding positive integers.
Each level of the factor is mapped to its integer position in the factor's levels.
}
\details{
This function is useful for converting categorical variables (factors) into numeric representations
when such transformation is required, for instance, in statistical or machine learning models that
need numeric inputs. It returns a numeric vector, where the factor levels are replaced with their
integer codes (starting from 1 for the first level).
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
factor_var <- factor(c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Low"))
fact_to_int(factor_var)
# Returns: [1, 2, 3, 1]
